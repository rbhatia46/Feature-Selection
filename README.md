# Feature-Selection
This repository contains 3 most important feature selection techniques used very frequently in a Data Science workflow to identify the best features for a Machine Learning model.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/version/1). I have explained all the features in detail in the notebook but to get a further insight, please go to the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/version/1) for the same. Also, I would suggest looking at the kernels for further applications to this.
